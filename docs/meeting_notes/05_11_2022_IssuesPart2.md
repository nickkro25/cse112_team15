**What we talked about today:**

- Made sure members that were missing on Tuesday would be able to get some exams to grade
- Went over some irregulerities in the code/testing
- Looked into why our testing was always failing (had to change the test since the test was out of date)
- Discussed our pull/push approval process
- Backend push checks (Pablo, Matthew) Front end push checks (Yizhou, Matthew) 
- Updated our project todos
- Made some UI acknowledgements:
  1. Inconsistent resizing (awkward transition only happens in tasks)
  2. Distraction button is good, but could be broken up into a no comment default and a comment option
  3. Colors are unloved :(
  4. logo needs work
  5. Dark mode needs some consistency
  6. Timer look is nice
  7. FAQ halo is odd
  8. Incosistency between rounding and corners
  9. We can consider using a "Hide tasks" feature
  10. Fix mobile! (maybe mobile can have smaller icons w/o text
  11. consider customizing the tour to better fit our theme
  12. Having a timeline of where you're at in the cycle
  13. Timer goes off to the left when below 10 min
- Picked a new color palate

**For next meeting:**
- Check issue progress/what people have done
- Work on our presentation
