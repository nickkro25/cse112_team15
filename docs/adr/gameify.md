# Game-ification of the Pomo Timer

- Status: On hold
- Date: 05/09/2022

## Context and Problem Statement

Deciding whether to add a game-like system to the app, and what kind of game system to have.

## Decision Drivers

### For:
* Extra incentive for user to continue doing their pomo sessions diligently
* A way to make our app more unique

### Against:
* Will require adding a lot of features for the user to unlock
* Becomes useless once the user unlocks everything?
* Seems like a lot of work

## Considered Options

* Currency system, gain points as you do sessions and buy stuff from a store
* Leveling system, gain levels as you do more sessions, and unlock new features as you grow in level.

## Decision Outcome

_**On hold**_; leveling system favored, but put on the backlog in favor of adding more robust features to the app instead of fluff at the moment.
